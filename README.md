# Project Orchestrator

> AI agent that helps non-coders build software projects by managing workflow between users and SCAR

## What Is This?

An AI-powered project management agent that translates natural language conversations into structured development workflows. Built to help non-technical people turn their ideas into working software.

## Vision

See the complete vision document: [`.agents/visions/project-orchestrator.md`](.agents/visions/project-orchestrator.md)

## Status

🚧 **In Development** - Currently in planning phase

## Quick Start

This project is being built using SCAR (the remote coding agent). Follow along with the development in the Issues tab.

## How It Works

```
You (natural language)
  ↓
Project Orchestrator (this project)
  ↓
SCAR (remote coding agent)
  ↓
Working Code
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Vision** → `.agents/visions/` - Non-technical project description
2. **PRD** → `docs/PRD.md` - Detailed requirements
3. **Plan** → `.agents/plans/` - Technical implementation plan
4. **Execute** → Actual code implementation
